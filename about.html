  <p>Thanks for checking out my website!</p>
  <p>This portfolio website gives you a glimpse of the work I've done this quarter and the HCI design principles I've learned.</p>
  <p>A few elements that I've focused on include ample white space, highlighted-graphics on mouseover, and strong defined lines to separate the menu bar and different components of the portfolio. I want to make it obvious to the reader on how to navigate. I also want to include some brief and concise explanation for each of the components of the portfolio, in case the reader is not immediately familiar to the layout of the course. </p>
  <p>Another key aspect of my design choice is consistency, which serves both a usability role and aesthetics role. Finally, with the exception of this write-up page, I focus on being concise and to-the-point whenever there is text. </p>
