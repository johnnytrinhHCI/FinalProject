  <p>For my bio page, I want to share what's not included in my resume. More specifically, I want to focus on some travelling I did, something that we can all look forward to once the COVID-19 situation improves.</p>

  <p>Since I've arrived in the US, EDM is something that really grew on me, so I really looked forward to the end of a week so I can bring a group to enjoy some of my favorite EDM artists. Some personal favorites are: Martin Garrix, Elephante, R3hab, and Tiesto</p>

  <p>I'm from Vietnam, and I've had the chance to bring a group of friends there. We all gained 5 to 10 lbs because the food was amazing! I can't wait for the opportunity to bring my next group!</p>

  <p>One of my favorite trips has to be the Northwestern ski trip of 2019. I fell more than 80 times over 4 days (I kept count because my friends thought it was funny).</p>
